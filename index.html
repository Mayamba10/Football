                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <p>
                    The roots of football stretch back thousands of years, with ancient civilizations like China, Greece, and Rome playing ball games resembling modern football. However, the sport as we know it began to take shape in England during the 19th century. The establishment of standardized rules by The Football Association in 1863 marked the birth of modern football.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the decades, football evolved rapidly. The first international match was played between Scotland and England in 1872. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the most prestigious tournament, watched by billions every four years. Today, football is played professionally in almost every country, with countless leagues and competitions.
